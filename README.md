# Monty-Hall

This project simulates the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. Users can interact with the program to select doors and observe outcomes under different strategies (switching or staying).

# Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure JDK is installed on your system.
Java IDE or Terminal: You can use an IDE like VS Code, IntelliJ, or Eclipse, or compile and run the code through the terminal.

# Project Structure
src/: Contains the source code files.
Monty_Hall.java: Main program file for the simulation.
Simulate.java: Supporting simulation logic.
images/: Contains visual assets (door images, car, goat).
bin/: Compiled .class files.
.vscode/: Configuration files for VS Code.

# How to Run
Using an IDE (e.g., VS Code)
Open the project folder in your IDE.
Ensure the images folder is in the same directory as the src folder for correct icon loading.
Set up your IDE to recognize the src folder as the source folder if necessary.
Compile and run the Monty_Hall.java file:
Locate the Monty_Hall.java file in the src folder.
Click the Run button or use the IDEâ€™s shortcut to execute the program.

# How to Play
1. Upon running the program, a graphical window will appear with three doors.
2. Select a door by clicking on it.
3. The program will reveal a goat behind one of the remaining doors.
4. You will then have the option to switch your choice or stay with your initial pick.
5. The final result will be displayed, showing whether you won or lost.
6. The terminal will also log game details such as the winning door, selected door, and whether switching led to a win.
